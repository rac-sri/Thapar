# Naive-Bayes-Classfier
Implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification.

The code is written from scratch and does NOT use existing functions or packages which can provide the Naive Bayes Classifier class or fit/predict function (e.g. sklearn).

I use Bank note authentication dataset, which can be downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication. Complete description of the dataset can be also found on that web-page.

The Implementation and some of it's functions are taken from this website (https://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-classifier-scratch-python/)
